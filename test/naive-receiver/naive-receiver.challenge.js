     * Exploit Overview
     * 
     * @dev
     * This challenge was about exploiting an existing receiver contract with the lending pool.
     * The main thing here is that we can control who the borrower is as that is under the 
     * attackers control.
     * 
     * Since the lending pools fee is 1 ether and the receiver contract has 10 ether we can 
     * execute a transaction that executes a flashLoan on behalf of the receiver. The 
     * receiver then processes and returns the flashloan with the fee.
     * 
     * To do this in one transaction, deploy a smart contract that has a function which 
     * calls the lender in a for loop 10 times. 
     * 
     * Contract Exploit file is located at:
     * "contracts/attacker-contracts/AttackNaiveReceiver.sol"
